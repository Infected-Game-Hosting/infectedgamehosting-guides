PALWORLD HOSTING:

Q: How much does Palworld server hosting cost?
A: Palworld server hosting starts at $11.00 per month. However, we're currently in a client testing phase where all active game instances receive monthly credits covering their hosting costs - meaning your server is free during testing!

Q: How many players can my Palworld server support?
A: This depends on your server tier and configuration. Our servers can support anywhere from 8-32+ players depending on the plan you choose and server specifications. We can help you determine the right size for your community.

Q: Can you install mods on my Palworld server?
A: Yes! We provide professional mod installation services. Simply submit a mod request through your client portal with the mod name or download link, and our team will install it safely within 4-6 hours. Never try to install mods yourself via FTP as this can break your server.

TECHNICAL QUESTIONS:
